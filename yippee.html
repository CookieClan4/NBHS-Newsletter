            <h1>Newsletter Name</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="email-body">
            <h2>Brand New Unicorn Newsletter!</h2>
            <p>For those reading this template, the only two sections I request to be read are this one and the very bottom/footer. This will be sort
            of a braindump, so the actual articles are just ideas and explanations. Keep in mind, all of this can be changed. This is simply 
            to provide an inspiration/template for the newsletter. Any critiques and ideas are welcome. Just know that I am very new to coding (which 
            is required to make this newsletter all pretty, as this one is) and that my skills may be limited. I hope to have a "council" of
            students working with me, each with individual jobs (some mentioned at the very bottom) and points of views on the newsletter.</p>
            
            <p>This will serve as the most important section, where any super important information or changes can be posted here. As the heading
            suggests, the first one could be the announcement of this newsletter, providing an explanation for how it works and whatnot. The
            following are some ideas for separate articles that we can post weekly for students to access.</p>
            
            <h3>Recognitions</h3>
            <p>Here, we can recognize students that have represented our school in various ways. For example, if a student places in a sporting
            event, we can put their accomplishment and name here. I decided to put this at the top for now, to ensure they get the attention
            they deserve.</p>
            
            <h3>Sporting Events</h3>
            <p>We have many sporting events these next couple weeks Unicorns!<br>
            <b>Soccer:</b><br>
            1/21 Junior Varsity Mens and Womens v. Wagner<br>
            1/21 Varsity Mens and Womens v. Wagner<br> 
            1/24 Junior Varsity Mens and Womens v. Kerrville<br>

            1/24 Varsity Tournament<br>
            
            <br>For the athletic full calender and locations, <a href="https://app.rankone.com/Calendar/Default.aspx?S=2647&D=00a83ba0-61d5-48df-9af9-48e7c4b9a71c">click here</a>.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Clubs</h3>
            <p>Here, we can put out any new information on clubs. One thing would be any new clubs that have been created. Another could be
            a link to a list of all clubs for anyone deciding to join any.</p>
            
            <h3>Important Dates</h3>
            <p>Here, there can be a list of important upcoming events. Examples could be alternate schedules (e.g. pep rallies), end date of 
            the 9 weeks, transcript release days, homecoming/prom, etc. Links can also be put here as hyperlinks.</p>
            
            <h3>Dress Up Days</h3>
            <p>Here, if there are upcoming dress up or spirit days, we can create a list of the days so students can prepare accordingly. I
            have noticed that it is difficult for students to know when these days are, including our last spirit days during December.</p>
            
            <h3>Important Links</h3>
            <p>To be honest, I ran out of ideas. Here we can put some general important links for students to access, such as nbisd.org. We
            can also create documents, in collaboration with staff, that can serve as resources for students (e.g. counselors with emails).
            Hyperlinks can be put here like <a href="www.google.com">this one</a>, which redirects the person to google.com.</p>
            
            <h3>Misc.</h3>
            <p>This is a placeholder for any other articles that can be placed in the newsletter. Pretty much anything can be placed here. Some
            could be fun, even, like an article for Senior Pranks as an example.</p>
            
        </div>

        <div class="email-footer">
            <p>Here, this is the footer. I had multiple ideas for what could go here. First and foremost, credits for the council creating
            this newsletter, with their own emails to be contacted.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we of course cannot work with all staff, such as coaches, clubs sponsors, and the sorts. I am unsure if it would be through 
            emails or a google form. If possible, it would be great if the council our own email we could all use where we can receive emails and organize 
            them in accordance of whomever is responsible for certain parts of the newsletter, as Gmail has the tool to create separate inboxes that emails 
            can be organized into.</p>
            <p>Lastly, anything else can be put here. I apologize for making the information long in some sections, but this is a very rough draft of
            what this could look like. I did not test this email format in Gmail, so if it is funky or something doesn't work I can work on it. I
            will be saving this on my personal account on onecompiler.com to access it later.</p>
